Hello! IÂ´m Ruth. Front-End Developer

I am a self-taught developer based in Spain. 
Since I was a little girl I have always been related to art in many different ways, but later on I discovered the "magic" of painting
with code and realized my love for Front-End development.
I am a desing enthusiast and enjoy bringing ideas to life in the browser.
